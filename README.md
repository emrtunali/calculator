**C#.NET Calculator with Database Recording**

**Summary**

This project is a calculator developed with C#.NET that supports four basic operations as well as percentage calculation. The calculator records all operations performed by connecting to a database. This makes it easy to access past calculations.

**Features**

* Four basic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
* Percentage calculation
* Database recording
* Docker support for virtual machines

**Usage**

To use the calculator, follow these steps:

1. Open the calculator.
2. Enter the first number.
3. Select the operation.
4. Enter the second number.
5. Click the Calculate button.

The calculator will display the result of the operation. The operation will also be recorded in the database.
